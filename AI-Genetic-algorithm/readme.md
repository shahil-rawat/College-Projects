Welcome to the graph coloring genetic algorithm!

This program is designed to solve the graph coloring problem using a genetic algorithm approach. 
This graph coloring problem involves assigning 3 colors to all the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
This program takes in a graph as input and produces a valid coloring of the graph as output.
You can also modify the program to change the parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as the population size and the mutation rate.

I hope you find this program helpful in solving the graph coloring problem!
